# What is  Virtual Envirement?
# > An environment which is same as the system interpreter but is isolated from the other Python environments on the system.
# > We need virtual environments to keep each project’s packages separate. This way:
# > No Conflicts: Different projects can use different package versions.
# > Clean Setup: Only the needed packages are installed for each project.
# > Easier Sharing: Others can run your project with the same setup.
# > It makes projects simpler to manage and avoids problems

# To install the virtual environment tool in Python, you can use this command:
# 		pip install virtualenv
# To create envirement,  you can use this command:
# 	            virtualenv myname (name kch b rkh skty jo ap chahty)To activate my virtual envirement
#                         myenvirementname\Scripts\activate
# Activate hone se phly Command Promt me asy dekht ga

# Virtual Enviremnt Install Hone k bad asy dekhy ga with env its mean It now activated

# VS CODE me env nae dekhay de ga but hmne activate kia o ga envirement to wo usi me sb kch 
# install kry ga
# PIP FREEZE COMMAND
# ‘The command pip freeze lists all the installed packages and their versions in your current environment.. 
# 		pip freeze
# saves a list of all the packages and their versions in your virtual environment to a file called requirements.txt.
# 		pip freeze > requirements.txt
# Share Dependencies: You can share this file with others so they know exactly which packages to install to run your project.
# Easily Recreate the Environment: Anyone can use pip install -r requirements.txt to install all the same packages in a new environment, ensuring the project runs consistently.

# We can distribute this file to other users, and they can recreate the same environment using:

# 		pip install –r requirements.txt
# By using this commands we can intasll all package of requirement. txt file at once. no one by
# one
