# PRACTICE SET 4
# Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80


a = int(input("Enter the value of a: "))
b = int(input("Enter the value of b: "))
print("\n")
print("The Value of a is:",a)
print("The Value of b is:",b)
print("\n")
print("A is greater than b is:",a>b)
